# ElectronPhoenixBoilerplate

### What is this?
This is a project that lets you use elixir, via phoenix and electron, to write a desktop app.

### Why?
Pretty UI + business logic in Elixir........, why not?

### Should you be doing this?
Should anybody be doing anything? Should you use this in a real, production-y setting? Probably not? But then again, maybe you should? Who knows?

## Getting Setup
  1. Make sure [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html), [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/downloads), [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) are installed. The most current versions at time of writing are: 1.4.2, 19.3, 1.2.0, and 0.23.2 respectively.
  2. Update all your local elixir tooling: `$ mix do local.hex, local.rebar, local.phx`
  3. Install the elixir dependencies: `$ mix do deps.get, deps.compile, dialyzer --plt`
  4. Install the node dependencies: `$ yarn` (this will install the dependencies in the phoenix sub app as well)
  5. Fire up `phoenix.server` once on its own, just to be sure it's all ready to go: `$ iex -S mix phoenix.server` (you can shut it down after it starts up successfully)

## Running / Development
  1. Run `$ yarn start` to start the `electron` shell. In this project, `electron` handles firing up the `phoenix` elixir node
  2. In a separate shell, run `$ iex --sname YOUR_SHELL_NAME --remsh electron@YOUR_MACHINE_NAME` to connect to the node that `electron` started

## TODO
  - [x] Have `electron` spawn and kill an erlang node running `iex -S mix phoenix.server`
  - [x] Switch the elixir project to an umbrella project so that business logic can be fully separate from UI stuff
  - [x] Make Ye Ol' Standard Counter Example app
  - [ ] Use `distillery` to produce a `production` build
  - [ ] Make a final `electron` asar (probably with unpacked stuff for the `elixir` assets)
